# 🟢 YOUR PRODUCTION IS ACTIVE AND WORKING!

## Current Status (VERIFIED):
✅ **Frontend:** ACTIVE (GitHub Pages)  
✅ **Backend:** ACTIVE (Railway)  
✅ **Local Bridge:** RUNNING  

## Why GitHub Shows "Production Inactive":

### Your Architecture:
```
GitHub Repository
    ├── Frontend Code → Deployed to GitHub Pages (github-pages environment)
    └── Backend Code → Deployed to Railway (external service)
```

### GitHub Environments:
- **`production`** - Not used (shows inactive) ❌
- **`github-pages`** - Your ACTUAL frontend (ACTIVE) ✅

## The Truth:

| What GitHub Shows | Reality |
|-------------------|---------|
| production: inactive | This is NORMAL - you're not using GitHub's "production" environment |
| github-pages: active | Your frontend is LIVE at tunerobotics.xyz ✅ |

## Proof Everything Works:

### 1. Your Website is LIVE:
- https://tunerobotics.xyz ✅
- https://tunerobotics.xyz/frontend/pages/plug-and-play-databench-style.html ✅

### 2. Your Backend is LIVE:
- https://web-production-fdfaa.up.railway.app/health ✅

### 3. Real Installation Works:
- Local bridge running on port 7777 ✅
- Can install LeRobot ✅
- Auto-transitions to port detection ✅

## Simple Explanation:

GitHub's "production" environment is for deploying to GitHub's servers.
You're NOT using that - you're using:
- GitHub Pages for frontend (different environment)
- Railway for backend (external service)

**"Production inactive" is EXPECTED and CORRECT for your setup!**
