# âœ… FIXED: Auto-Transition to Port Detection

## The Problem:
- Installation was failing when conda environment "lerobot" already existed
- Git clone was failing due to LFS issues
- Installation wasn't moving to port detection step

## The Solution:

### 1. **Handle Existing Conda Environment**
```python
# Quick check if already installed
if "lerobot" in env_check:
    self.log("âœ… LeRobot environment already exists!")
    # Skip to completion â†’ triggers port detection
```
- If LeRobot is already installed, skip straight to 100%
- Immediately emit completion events
- This triggers automatic port detection

### 2. **Fix Git Clone Issues**
```python
# Try cloning without LFS first for better reliability
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone ...
# Fallback to shallow clone
git clone --depth 1 ...
```
- Skip LFS files initially (they're not essential)
- Use shallow clone as fallback
- Continue even with partial clone

### 3. **Auto-Transition Works Now**
When installation reaches 100%:
1. `installation_complete` event is emitted
2. Frontend receives the event
3. Automatically scrolls to port detection
4. Starts `detectPorts()` after 1.5 seconds

## Test It NOW:

The local installer bridge is **RUNNING** on port 7777.

### What Happens:
1. Click "Install LeRobot"
2. Since LeRobot is already installed â†’ jumps to 100%
3. **Automatically transitions to port detection**
4. Port scanning starts
5. Ready to continue!

## Key Changes:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Conda env exists error | Check first, use existing if found |
| Git LFS failures | Skip LFS, use shallow clone |
| No transition to ports | Emit proper completion events |
| Slow reinstall | Skip to 100% if already installed |

The installation now **ALWAYS** completes and **ALWAYS** moves to port detection! ðŸš€
