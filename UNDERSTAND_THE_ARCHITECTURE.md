# UNDERSTANDING YOUR DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

## 🏗️ How Your App Works:

Your app has **TWO SEPARATE PARTS** that must be deployed differently:

### 1. FRONTEND (Static Files) - GitHub Pages
- **What**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- **Where**: https://tunerobotics.xyz (GitHub Pages)
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING
- **Deploys**: Automatically when you push to GitHub

### 2. BACKEND (Python Server) - Railway
- **What**: Flask API server (Python code)
- **Where**: Should be on Railway (needs URL)
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CONFIGURATION
- **Issue**: No public URL generated yet

## 🔄 How They Connect:

```
User Browser → tunerobotics.xyz (GitHub Pages)
     ↓
JavaScript makes API calls
     ↓
Backend Server (Railway) ← THIS NEEDS A URL!
```

## ❌ Why "Production Inactive on GitHub"?

GitHub Pages **CANNOT** run Python/backend code!
- GitHub Pages = Static files only (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Railway = Dynamic backend server (Python/Flask)

When you see "Backend offline" on your site, it means:
- Frontend (GitHub Pages) is working ✅
- Backend (Railway) has no public URL ❌

## ✅ THE FIX:

### Step 1: Get Railway URL
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your project → service
3. Add PORT=8080 to Variables
4. Wait for redeploy
5. Get the generated URL

### Step 2: Update Frontend
```bash
./update_backend_url.sh https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
The script does this automatically!

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND:

If Railway is being difficult, use local backend:
```bash
./USE_LOCAL_BACKEND_NOW.sh
```

This will:
- Run backend locally on your computer
- Update frontend to use localhost
- Let you test everything immediately

## 📊 STATUS CHECK:

| Component | Location | Status | Action Needed |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Frontend | GitHub Pages | ✅ Working | None |
| Backend | Railway | ⚠️ No URL | Generate domain |
| Database | None needed | ✅ Using mock | None |

## 🎯 YOUR TASK:

1. **Get Railway URL** (see methods above)
2. **Run update script** with that URL
3. **Everything will work!**

Remember: GitHub Pages hosts frontend, Railway hosts backend!
