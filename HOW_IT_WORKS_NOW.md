# ✅ HOW THE INSTALLATION WORKS NOW

## The Reality:
**Websites CANNOT directly install software on computers** due to browser security (this prevents malware).

## The Solution That's Working RIGHT NOW:

### Option 1: One Command (Easiest)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lip-so/chatVLA/main/INSTALL_LEROBOT.sh | bash
```
This ONE command:
- Downloads everything needed
- Starts the local bridge
- Opens the website
- Enables REAL installation

### Option 2: If You Already Have chatVLA
```bash
cd ~/chatVLA && python3 local_installer_bridge.py
```
Then visit: https://tunerobotics.xyz/frontend/pages/plug-and-play-databench-style.html

## What Happens:

1. **Local Bridge Starts** (on port 7777)
   - This is a small Python server running on YOUR computer
   - It allows the website to trigger REAL installation

2. **Website Detects Bridge**
   - Shows green banner: "✅ REAL Installation Mode Active!"
   - Install button becomes functional

3. **Click "Install LeRobot"**
   - Website sends command to local bridge
   - Bridge runs ACTUAL installation commands:
     - Clones LeRobot repository
     - Creates conda environment
     - Installs dependencies
     - Sets up everything

4. **Real Installation Happens**
   - Progress shows in real-time
   - LeRobot is ACTUALLY installed on your computer
   - Not a mock, not a demo - REAL installation

## Test It NOW:

The local bridge is currently running (from earlier testing).
Visit the website and you'll see the green banner showing it's active:

## Why This Way?

- **Browser Security**: Websites can't run system commands (by design)
- **Local Bridge**: Acts as a secure intermediary
- **One Command**: As simple as technically possible
- **Real Installation**: Actually installs LeRobot, not just a demo

## Files That Make It Work:

- `local_installer_bridge.py` - The local server that enables installation
- `INSTALL_LEROBOT.sh` - One-command installer script
- `frontend/pages/plug-and-play-databench-style.html` - The web interface

This is the REAL, WORKING solution that's deployed and functional RIGHT NOW!
