# WHERE TO FIND THE DOMAIN IN RAILWAY (2024)

## I CAN'T FIND "NETWORKING" OR "TCP PROXY" - HERE'S WHERE IT ACTUALLY IS:

### METHOD 1: Add PORT Variable (This triggers domain option)
1. In Railway dashboard, click your **chatVLA** project
2. Click on your service
3. Click **Variables** tab
4. Click **+ New Variable**
5. Add:
   - Key: `PORT`
   - Value: `8080`
6. Click **Add**
7. Railway will redeploy (wait 2 minutes)
8. Go back to your service main page
9. **NOW you should see the domain option!**

### METHOD 2: Look in these EXACT places

#### Top of Service Panel
When you click your service, look at the **very top** of the right panel:
- You might see a URL already (if yes, that's your domain!)
- Or you might see a button like **"Add Domain"** or **"Expose"**

#### Settings Tab (if it exists)
1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN
3. Look for sections called:
   - **"Public Networking"**
   - **"Domains"**
   - **"Public URL"**
   - **"HTTP Networking"**

#### Service Card Icons
On your service card, look for:
- üåê Globe icon
- üîó Link icon
- "Expose" button
- "Generate URL" button

### METHOD 3: Install Railway CLI (Guaranteed to work)
```bash
# On Mac:
brew install railway

# Or use npm:
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Then:
railway login
railway link  # Choose your project
railway domain  # This WILL generate a domain
```

### IF NOTHING WORKS - Your Deployment Might Be Failing

Check your deployment status:
1. Click on your service
2. Look at the latest deployment
3. Should be GREEN/ACTIVE, not RED/FAILED

If it's failing:
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Click "View Logs"
3. Look for the error

Common fixes:
- Missing dependencies
- Wrong start command
- Port not set

### THE NUCLEAR OPTION - Create New Service
If all else fails:
1. In your project, click **+ New**
2. Choose **"Empty Service"**
3. Go to its Settings
4. Connect your GitHub repo
5. It should auto-detect and show domain option

### WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR:
Once you find it, Railway will give you:
```
https://chatvla-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

Copy this URL and run:
```bash
./update_backend_url.sh https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app
```

## IMPORTANT: Railway UI keeps changing!
The domain option might be in different places depending on:
- Your account type
- When you created the project
- Railway's latest UI update

But it's ALWAYS there somewhere - you just need to find it!
